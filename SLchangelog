Fixes Update
- 3114 is now fixed and back to being playable.
Guns held by 3114 will have no ammo to prevent any chance of them being able to get lucky with a low hp kill.
3114 Normal melee damage Decreased 40 -> 34 (same reason as 939 to not 3 shot light vests)

- 244 is now back and slightly changed.
While in 244 you will get a slight chill effect on your hud and it will continue to deal damage until the effect has worn off.
244 no longer deals increased damage to flams to prevent the entire wave dying from a 244 at the elevator.
035 Only takes 1x Damage from 244

- You can now Cuff with guns. (PC ONLY)
Holding a Gun and Holding E while facing a person not holding an item will cuff them.
Cuffs still exist for non pc users.

- Cuffed escapes are also buffed.
Cuffed escapes now result in 1-2 random spectators also spawning as that escaped class.
1 Cuffed Class-D = 2-3 MTF Cadets
1 Cuffed Facility Personnel = 2-3 CI Beta

- Vector VM has been adjusted a bit to make the ads better.

3114 Damage Nerf 34 -> 20

Also the inventory icon for these guns will be custom.

Recruiter Fix
People recruited no longer stay cuffed.

GOC Operator Nerf
Minigun Damage Decreased 4.5 -> 3.5
